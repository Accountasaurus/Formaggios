Chris Paul provides us will daily sales data that we use to give him estimates and data on his business.  
Strip away all data other than the date for week ending and the sales values themselves. 

Evenings.R and lunches.R are the scripts used to do this analysis.  
        -The files that get loaded into these scripts must be named evenings.csv and lunches.csv

We also take the number sold per item from quickbooks to do confidence estimates that will 
allow Chris to make a prep schedule. This script is called Prep.R and the files used for this script have the prefix of "Items Sold"
